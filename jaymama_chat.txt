[26/07/20, 11:09:40] Pranu: Jay mama we though of giving vehicles, other than those that belong to Hyundai, a try as we wanted our car to be something new into the society like Honda City (the new version) or Kia Seltos or MG( but this didn’t fit into the budget)
[26/07/20, 11:10:40] Jay Mama: Ok nice
[26/07/20, 11:10:45] Jay Mama: Who’s is driving

[26/07/20, 11:16:25] Pranu: Thoughts about my car haven’t been pondered over yet
[26/07/20, 11:17:44] Pranu: Well even Venue is new into the society but yet we’ll didn’t like the model for unknown reasons
[26/07/20, 11:18:17] Jay Mama: Ya check on those website and videos in our budget
[26/07/20, 11:19:50] Pranu: Hmm.. currently on it in fact we’re planning to pay a visit to the Honda City and Kia showrooms
[26/07/20, 11:19:59] Pranu: To have a clear set look at the cars
[26/07/20, 11:20:11] Jay Mama: Ok 👍🏻
[26/07/20, 11:20:58] Pranu: Ok jay mama I think it’s real mid night for u good night then bye

[26/07/20, 11:21:41] Pranu: Ohh
[28/07/20, 09:19:57] Pranu: Jay mama, yesterday after u said abt those anonymous logins into Babaye’s account, I just intimated all my friends in a soft tone to double check that they are entering Netflix only through my profile, but they replied they never did enter any other profile and also i personally keep checks on them and their viewing history regularly. For sure these are not the guys and I guess it could have been Pranu’s (Pranay’s) friends. Just guess
[28/07/20, 09:39:56] Jay Mama: Ok no problem
[28/07/20, 09:40:06] Jay Mama: It’s all Part of youth life
[28/07/20, 09:51:43] Pranu: I know but just making it clear that it’s not my friends and by the way, besides cautioning my friends about login I myself ironically logged into Babaye’s account by mistake this morning!

I know it’s coming youth life as u said but this time it’s not we 

That was a punch line(😜) 😁😁
[28/07/20, 09:52:17] Pranu: Okay GN jay mama, might have been really tiered

[15/08/20, 10:36:12] Pranu: Loop hole: I need to uninstall windows seven residing on my IMac and install windows 10 for all of this to happen I need to get my mac keyboard fixed in the first place(which could be done once we go to Vijayawada)
[15/08/20, 10:47:45] Jay Mama: Check the cable option pranu
[15/08/20, 10:59:14] Pranu: I’ll but why cable when it can be done without cable?

[29/08/20, 07:38:53] Pranu: Raw!!! Yet funny. In fact Jay mama in our batch too there was a guy, he attended the college for the first 2-3 months of first year and disappeared suddenly and finally just before 2 months to IIT exams in second year he appeared. He was the centre of attraction then when sirs asked him what happened to him all these 1:5 years, he said like he was preparing for CA exams and now he wanted to prepare for JEE so he came
[29/08/20, 07:39:14] Pranu: Almost similar to answers given in the video but no cuss words
[29/08/20, 07:39:44] Pranu: Finally, lecturers took him in as he has a point “I paid fee now what’s ur problem”
[30/08/20, 12:24:38] Pranu: Though it doesn’t work always, yet it’s still a fun always to fool others. Isn’t it??!!

[27/09/20, 00:00:23] Pranu: The "Le Petit Chef (Little Chef)" restaurant in France, came up with an original way to entertain guests while waiting for their order by using an overhead 3D projector on the ceiling.  The animation is on the table and your plate. There is a small chef who appears on your plate, and that’s only the beginning.

‎[28/01/21, 23:54:40] Pranu: IDEA 104 - Dream-Discover-Disrupt - I.docx • ‎2 pages ‎document omitted
[28/01/21, 23:55:24] Pranu: This is our elective course offering Jay mama it’s not available to us now but anyway would be available in third year
‎[29/01/21, 08:43:10] Pranu: Minor Courses offered for 2019 Batch.docx • ‎1 page ‎document omitted
[29/01/21, 08:43:39] Pranu: These are all the minors that are being offered this Sem
[29/01/21, 09:07:43] Jay Mama: Sure Pranu will checkout and let you know by Sunday
[29/01/21, 09:08:10] Pranu: Ya jay mama no probs
[29/01/21, 09:09:56] Pranu: But just be known that the deadline for this registration is 31.1.2021 and it’s limited seats
[29/01/21, 09:16:53] Jay Mama: This is really interesting course pranu. Take it whenever available
[29/01/21, 09:17:49] Jay Mama: AI & ML course feels valuable. What u think nana ?
[29/01/21, 09:18:27] Pranu: Ya but this is for other departments other than CSE cause we will get this in the main stream in third year
[29/01/21, 09:19:17] Pranu: So this would be available in third year Jay mama as it is an elective so I’ll pick it when offered to me
[29/01/21, 09:21:30] Pranu: So Jay mama I feel for this sem I could just start an online psychology course and let go the minors. And in the third sem as you said I could pick the IDEA 104 course as elective
[29/01/21, 09:22:38] Jay Mama: Ok 👍🏻
[29/01/21, 09:22:56] Pranu: Because taking any minor now could burden the work of taking that interesting IDEA 104 course in next year
[29/01/21, 09:23:14] Pranu: Because minor lasts for 4 years
[29/01/21, 09:24:33] Jay Mama: Oh nice , Do whatever u feel interesting u know better than anyone
[29/01/21, 09:25:18] Pranu: True ok then this sem a self learning online Yale university psychology course and next year the BBA elective

[06/03/21, 19:05:21] Jay Mama: Let’s wait and see PlayStation is available
[06/03/21, 19:05:47] Pranu: It seems that people with computers and tech knowledge are using Bots to buy Xbox soon after they get into stores!! Since bots are faster than humans they are making transactions faster and these tech guys are later selling the products for double the price
[06/03/21, 19:06:06] Jay Mama: https://youtu.be/kjfu78xo7ZM
[06/03/21, 19:06:44] Pranu: Ya but Jay mama there’s actually nothing good to play on play station like I would like to play Forza, red dead redemption and games like that they are top notch
[06/03/21, 19:07:05] Pranu: And Xbox series S is that we have to pay subscription so that’s gonna cost us more than series X
[06/03/21, 19:07:11] Pranu: In two to three years
[06/03/21, 19:07:38] Pranu: Which could be played on Xbox alone By the way
[06/03/21, 19:08:02] Jay Mama: Oh no 🤦‍♂️ Inka wait cheyyaddam. Thappa we can’t do anything Kada
[06/03/21, 19:09:18] Pranu: Yaa no probs seems like series x gonna come soon
[06/03/21, 19:09:33] Pranu: I waited this long I’m ready to wait a couple more months
[06/03/21, 19:09:51] Pranu: Because even if I get Series S or play station I won’t be satisfied
